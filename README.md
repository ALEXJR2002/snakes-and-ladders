# Snakes and Ladders
## **Description**
The game presents the user with a grid or table of n rows by m columns, within which there are s snakes and e ladders. 
Each of the squares in the grid can be identified by a number. The numbering starts in the lower left cell with the number 1, continues in the cell immediately to the right and so on until the end of the row. Then it goes up in that same column and back to the left, thus interspersing the direction in each row.

The game consists of p players starting their journey across the board at square 1, moving in turn a number of squares equal to the number of squares shown by the die rolled at that time for that player. The players move in the same order in which the squares are numbered. In the end, the player who reaches the square numbered with the highest number first wins.
